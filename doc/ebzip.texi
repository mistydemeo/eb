@chapter Introduction

@code{ebzip} is a command to compress/uncompress CD-ROM books for 
EB Library applications.
EB Library applications can access compressed CD-ROM books without
any functional restriction.
(But, their access speed to compressed books may be slower than that
to original books.)
Since the compression data format is independent of CPU type,
operating system, and file system, files compressed by @code{ebzip}
can be interchanged.
The @code{ebzip} command is distributed with EB Library.

@code{ebzip} is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)
any later version.

@code{ebzip} is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but @emph{without any warranty}; without even the implied warranty of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

In addition, you must follow the licenses of your CD-ROM books.
Though @code{ebzip} is free software, your books may not be free.
If the publishers of your CD-ROM don't permit to copy the book onto a
hard disk (nor other strage devices), please give up compress the book.

This is edition @value{EDITION}, for EB Library version @value{VERSION}.

@c ===================================================================
@node Action and Command Name, Invoking ebzip, Introduction, Top
@chapter Action and Command Name

@code{ebzip} has three @dfn{action} modes; compression, uncompression
and information.

@itemize @bullet
@item compression
@*
Compress a CD-ROM book.

@item uncompression
@*
Uncompress a CD-ROM book compressed by @code{ebzip}.

@item information
@*
Output information about compression status of a CD-ROM book compressed
by @code{ebzip}.

@end itemize

@noindent
When @code{ebzip} is invoked, the action is determined by invoked
name of the @code{ebzip} command and command line options to
@code{ebzip}.
The action is never changed during an execution of @code{ebzip}.

@code{ebzip} has installed with three different command names;
@code{ebzip}, @code{ebunzip} and @code{ebzipinfo}.
(On DOS and Windows systems, @code{ebzipinfo} is renamed to
@code{ebzipinf}).
Usually, they are hard-linked like as follows:

@example
@group
% ls -li ebzip ebunzip ebzipinfo
38787 -rwxr-xr-x  3 bin   bin     73728 Jun 27 22:48 ebunzip
38787 -rwxr-xr-x  3 bin   bin     73728 Jun 27 22:48 ebzip
38787 -rwxr-xr-x  3 bin   bin     73728 Jun 27 22:48 ebzipinfo
@end group
@end example

@noindent
When it is invoked as @code{ebunzip}, the default action is uncompression.
When it is invoked as @code{ebzipinfo}, information is the default
action.
Otherwise, the default action is compression.

In addition, you can specify the action by the command line options;
@samp{--compress} (@samp{-z}), @samp{--uncompress} (@samp{-u}) and
@samp{--information} (@samp{-i}).
They are prior to invoked names.
In the following example, "compress" is the action of all the lines:

@example
@group
ebunzip
ebzip --uncompress
ebzipinfo --uncompress
@end group
@end example

@c ===================================================================
@node Invoking ebzip, Compression, Action and Command Name, Top
@chapter Invoking @code{ebzip}

Its usual way to invoke @code{ebzip}, @code{ebunzip} and @code{ebzipinfo}
are as follows:

@example
@group
% ebzip @var{book-path}
% ebunzip @var{book-path}
% ebzipinfo @var{book-path}
@end group
@end example

@noindent
@var{book-path} points to the top directory of a CD-ROM book where
the file @file{CATALOG} or @file{CATALOGS} resides.
@code{ebzip} compresses a book at @var{book-path},
@code{ebunzip} uncompresses a book at @var{book-path},
and @code{ebzipinfo} outputs information about a book at @var{book-path}.

Though you cannot specify two or more book-paths, 
you can omit book-path like as follows:

@example
@group
% ebzip
% ebunzip
% ebzipinfo
@end group
@end example

@noindent
In this case, it is assumed that the current working directory
(@file{.}) is specified.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Compression Example 1, Compression Example 2, Compression, Compression
@section Example of Compression (1)

This section explains how to compress your CD-ROM book which has
already copied on a hard disk.
Supporse that you have already copied a CD-ROM book to @file{/dict}
on a hard disk, but it is not compressed.
The book has the following files under @file{/dict}.

@example
@group
/dict/catalog
/dict/language
/dict/kanji/start
/dict/english/start
@end group
@end example

@noindent
You can compress the book by the following way:

@example
% cd /dict
% ebzip
@end example

@noindent
This is equivalent to:

@example
% ebzip --output-directory /dict /dict
@end example

@noindent
Compression may take a while.
@code{ebzip} outputs status messages during the compression like as
follows:

@example
@group
==> compress /dict/kanji/start <==
output to ./dict/kanji/start.ebz
 1.0% done (2097152 / 220069888 bytes)
 1.9% done (4194304 / 220069888 bytes)
 2.9% done (6291456 / 220069888 bytes)
        : (snip)
completed (220069888 / 220069888 bytes)
220069888 -> 78163751 bytes (35.5%)
@end group
@end example

@noindent
When the compression has done, the directory structure under
@file{/dict} is slightly changed.

@example
@group
/dict/catalog
/dict/language.ebz
/dict/kanji/start.ebz
/dict/english/start.ebz
@end group
@end example

@noindent
The suffix @samp{.ebz} is added to the some files (@file{/dict/language.ebz},
@file{/dict/kanji/start.ebz} and @file{/dict/english/start.ebz}).
They are compressed files.
Other files are unchanged.

@code{ebzip} compresses the following files; @file{START}, @file{HONMON},
@file{LANGUAGE}, and font files under the @file{GAIJI} directories.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Compression Example 2, Compression Level, Compression Example 1, Compression
@section Example of Compression (2)

This section shows another example.
This section explains how to compress files in a CD-ROM disc and
put them onto a hard disk.
Suppose that and original CD-ROM book is mounted on @file{/cdrom}
and that the book has the following files under @file{/cdrom}.

@example
@group
/cdrom/catalog
/cdrom/language
/cdrom/german/start
/cdrom/french/start
/cdrom/italian/start
@end group
@end example

Execute the following commands to compress the book an put it on
@file{/dict}:

@example
@group
% cd /dict
% ebzip --keep /cdrom
@end group
@end example

@noindent
This is equivalent to:

@example
% ebzip --keep --output-directory /dict /cdrom
@end example

@noindent
Please note that the output directory @file{/dict} may be empty, but
it must have been created before compression.
In this example, the @samp{--keep} option is used.
By default, @code{ebzip} deletes original files after compression, but
the @samp{--keep} option disables this behavior.

The directory strcture under @file{/dict} and @file{/cdrom} are almost
the same, but the suffix @samp{.ebz} is added to the compressed files
under @file{/dict}.

@example
@group
/dict/catalog
/dict/language.ebz
/dict/german/start.ebz
/dict/french/start.ebz
/dict/italian/start.ebz
@end group
@end example

@noindent
The intermediate directories, @file{/dict/german}, @file{/dict/french}
and @file{/dict/italian}, are created by @code{ebzip} if missing.
@file{CATALOG} and @file{CATALOGS} are simply copied to the output
directory.
@code{ebzip} ignores files and directories not supported by EB Library.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Compression Level, Test, Compression Example 2, Compression
@section Compression Level

@code{ebzip} supports six compression levels, from 0 to 5.
The compression level 0 is the fastest compression/uncompression method,
but it is the worst compression method.
The compression level 5 is the best compression method but it is the
slowest compression/uncompression method.
The compression level is set by the @samp{--level} (@samp{-l}) option.

@example
% ebzip --level 2 --output-directory /dict /dict
@end example

@noindent
The default level is 0 (fastest but worst).

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Test, Partial Compression, Compression Level, Compression
@section Test

Invoking @code{ebzip} with the @code{--test} (@code{-t}) option,
@code{ebzip} doesn't write compressed data to actual files.
This is usuful when you want to know the sizes of compressed files
before compression.

@example
% ebzip --test /dict /dict
@end example

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Partial Compression, Overwrite Old Files, Test, Compression
@section Partial Compression

@code{ebzip} compresses an entire book by default,
but the @samp{--subbook} (@samp{-S}) and @samp{--skip-content}
(@samp{-s}) options allow you to compress part of a book.

The @samp{--subbook} option takes an argument which is a list of
directory names of subbooks to be compressed, separeted by a comma
(@samp{,}).
The @code{ebinfo} command tells you what subbooks your book contains
and what their directory names are.

@example
@group
% ebinfo /mnt/cdrom
disc type: EB/EBG/EBXA/EBXA-C/S-EBXA
character code: JIS X 0208
the number of subbooks: 3

@end group
@group
subbook 1:
  title: New English Japanese Dictionary (4th edition)
  directory: english
  search methods: word endword keyword menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 0xa121 -- 0xa24e
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

@end group
@group
subbook 2:
  title: CD-ROM French Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
  directory: french
  search methods: word endword keyword menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

@end group
@group
subbook 3:
  title: Pocket German Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
  directory: german
  search methods: menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
@end group
@end example

@noindent
(@xref{Invoking ebinfo, , Invoking @code{ebinfo}, ebinfo, ebinfo},
for more details about the @code{ebinfo} command).
@*
In this example, there are three subbooks in the book, and their
directory names are @code{english}, @code{french} and @code{german}.
By the following, you can compress @code{english} and @code{french}:

@example
% ebzip --subbook english,french /dict
@end example

@noindent
Case of the directory names are not sensitve.
An argument to @samp{--subbook} can be splitted like as follows:

@example
% ebzip --subbook english --subbook french /dict
@end example

@noindent
Files in the rest subbooks (@code{german} in this example) are not
compressed nor copied, so that the compression procedure for the book
is incompleted at this point.
In order to use the book, you must compress the rest subbooks in a
further operation, or deletes the rest subbooks from a subbook list in
the @file{CATALOG(S)} file by using the @code{ebrefile} command
(@xref{Combination with ebzip, , Combination with @code{ebzip}, ebrefile,
ebrefile}, for more details).
You can compress subbooks with different compression levels
(e.g. compress @code{english} and @code{french} with level 0, and 
compress @code{german} with level 2).

The @samp{--skip-content} (@samp{-s}) is similar to @samp{--subbook},
but @samp{--skip-content} specifies data types of files to be ignored.

@example
% ebzip --skip-content sound,movie --subbook french /dict
@end example

@noindent
In this example, @code{ebzip} skips sound and movie files.
The data type names currently recognized by @code{ebzip} are:
@code{font}, @code{graphic}, @code{sound} and @code{movie}.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Overwrite Old Files, Compress Compressed Book, Partial Compression, Compression
@section Overwrite Old Files

@code{ebzip} asks you whether a file may be overwritten or not when the
file already exists.

@example
@group
==> compress /dict/science/data/honmon <==
output to /dict/science/data/honmon.ebz

the file already exists: /dict/science/data/honmon.ebz
do you wish to overwrite (y or n)? 
@end group
@end example

@noindent
Please answer @samp{y} or @samp{n}.
If you answer as @samp{n}, @code{ebzip} skips the file.

When the @samp{--force-overwrite} option is specified, @code{ebzip}
overwrites existed files without confirmation.
Similary, when the @samp{--no-overwrite} option is specified,
@code{ebzip} skips the file without confirmation.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Compress Compressed Book,  , Overwrite Old Files, Compression
@section Compress Compressed Book

Also S-EBXA and EPWING define compression formats, and some CD-ROM
books of S-EBXA and EPWING are compressed with the formats.
The formats are different from the ebzip compression format.

@code{ebzip} (@code{ebunzip}) can also uncompress CD-ROM book
compressed with the EPWING or S-EBXA compression fomrat, but it cannot
compress book with the format.

If you command @code{ebzip} to compress a CD-ROM book which has been
compressed with a compression format, @code{ebzip} automatically
uncompresses the book and compresses it with the ebzip compression.

Compression ratio of the ebzip compression format is generally better
than those of EPWING and S-EBXA formats.

@c ===================================================================
@node Uncompression, Information, Compression, Top

Uncompression procedure is closely similar to compression.
Suppose that a compressed subbook resides under @file{/dict}.
The book has the following files under @file{/dict}.

@example
@group
/dict/catalog
/dict/language.ebz
/dict/kanji/start.ebz
/dict/english/start.ebz
@end group
@end example

@noindent
This is equivalent to:

@example
% ebunzip --output-directory /dict /dict
@end example

@noindent
Uncompression may take a while.
@code{ebunzip} outputs status messages during the uncompression like
as follows:

@example
@group

25681439 -> 82460672 bytes
@end group
@end example

@noindent
During the uncompression, @code{ebunzip} asks you whether an existed file
may be overwritten or not:

@example

@noindent
When the uncompression has done, the directory structure under
@file{dict} is slightly changed.

@example
@group
/dict/catalog

@noindent
Uncompressed files change their filenames;
the suffix @samp{.ebz} is removed from them.

@node Format Overview, Data Part, Compressed File Format, Compressed File Format
@appendixsec Overview about Compression File Format

The compressed file format has the following features.

@itemize @bullet
@item
independent of CPU type, operating system, and file system.

@item
loss-less compression.@*
You can recover an original file by uncompressing the compressed
file.

@item
four compression levels.@*
You can choose faster or better compression.
@end itemize

A compressed file consists of header, index and data parts.
They are placed in that order.

@example
@group
+--------+-------------+-----------------------------+
| header |    index    |            data             |
+--------+-------------+-----------------------------+
                                                     EOF
@end group
@end example

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Data Part, Index Part, Format Overview, Compressed File Format
@appendixsec Data Part

An orignal file is compressed by the following processes.

At first, @code{ebzip} slices an original file.
Each @dfn{slice} except for the last slice (slice N in the following
picture) has the same size.

@example
@group
+---------------+---------------+--   --+----------+
|    slice 1    |    slice 2    |  ...  | slice N  |
+---------------+---------------+--   --+----------+
                                                   EOF
@end group
@end example

@noindent
Slice size is determined by the compression level
(@pxref{Compression Level}, about compression level):

@multitable @columnfractions .5 .5
@item compression level  @tab  slice size
@item 0                  @tab   2048 bytes
@item 1                  @tab   4096 bytes
@item 2                  @tab   8192 bytes
@item 3                  @tab  16384 bytes
@item 4                  @tab  32768 bytes
@item 5                  @tab  65536 bytes
@end multitable

@noindent
Second, if the last slice is shorter than the slice size, @code{ebzip}
extends the last slice to the slice size by padding bytes of 0x00.

@example
@group
                                                    pad 
+---------------+---------------+--   --+---------+-----+
|    slice 1    |    slice 2    |  ...  |    slice N    |
+---------------+---------------+--   --+---------+-----+
                                                        EOF
@end group
@end example

@noindent
Finally, @code{ebzip} compresses each slice into the DEFLATE compressed
data format, described in RFC 1951.
A slice is compressed independently of another slice.
Usually, each compressed slice occupies different size.
If the number of bits of the compressed slice is not a multiple of 8,
1 to 7 bits are padded to the number of bits come to a multiple of 8
at the tail of the compressed slice.
Thus, each compressed slice starts at byte boundary.
The contents of the padded bits are undefined, but the padded bits are
never used.

@example
@group
+------------+----------+--   --+--------------+
| compressed |compressed|  ...  |  compressed  |
|   slice 1  | slice 2  |  ...  |   slice N    |
+------------+----------+--   --+--------------+
@end group
@end example

@noindent
This is a @dfn{data part} of the compressed file format, which consists
of compressed slices.

The padding in the last slice is compressed as a part of the slice.
When @code{ebunzip} recovers the last slice, it uncompresses the slice
and then remove the padding.

When a compressed slice is larger than or equal to slice size, 
@code{ebzip} discards the compressed data of the slice.
In this case, @code{ebzip} records original data as the compressed data
for that slice instead.

If an original file is empty, the data part is not appered in a
compressed file.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Index Part, Header Part, Data Part, Compressed File Format
@appendixsec Index Part

At compression, @code{ebzip} records an @dfn{index} for each compressed
slice.
An index represents a distance betweeen the beginning of the compressed
file to the beginning of a compressed slice.
The unit of the distance is byte.

@example
@group
+---------+---------+--           --+---------+---------+
| index 1 | index 2 |  ...........  | index N |index END|
+---------+---------+--           --+---------+---------+
     |         |                        |         |
 +---+         +----+                   +------+  +-----------+
 V                  V                          V              V
+------------------+------------------+--   --+--------------+
|    compressed    |    compressed    |  ...  |  compressed  |
|      slice 1     |     slice 2      |  ...  |   slice N    |
+------------------+------------------+--   --+--------------+
@end group
@end example

@noindent
Each index takes from 2 to 4 bytes, according with size of an original
file:

@multitable @columnfractions .7 .3
@item original file size             @tab  index size
@item        0 ...      65535 bytes  @tab  2 bytes
@item    65535 ...   16777215 bytes  @tab  3 bytes
@item 16777216 ... 4294967295 bytes  @tab  4 bytes
@end multitable

All multi-byte numbers in the indexes stored with the most significant
byte first.
For example, 0x1234 is stored as follows.
First byte holds 0x12, and second byte holds 0x34.

@example
@group
+---------+---------+
|0001 0010|0011 0100|
+---------+---------+
  (0x12)    (0x34)
@end group
@end example

The index part begins with the index for the compressed slice 1, and 
the index for the compressed slice 2 follows it.
The index for compressed slice N is followed by the index for END;
index for the next byte of the end of the compressed slice N.
This index also represents the size of the compressed file.

@example
@group
+---------+---------+--       --+---------+---------+
| index 1 | index 2 |  .......  | index N |index END|
+---------+---------+--       --+---------+---------+
@end group
@end example

If its size is equal to the slice size, the data of the slice is not
compressed accutually.

If an original file is empty, the index part has only one index.
The index represents the size of the compressed file.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Header Part,  , Index Part, Compressed File Format
@appendixsec Header Part

A header part occupies 22 bytes.
It consists of the following fields.

@example
@group
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
|   magic ID   |*1| *2  |    file size    | Adler-32  |   mtime   |
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21

*1: zip mode and compression level
*2: reserved area
@end group
@end example

@table @code
@item magic ID (5 bytes)
It has the fixed value; 0x45, 0x42, 0x5a, 0x69, 0x70 (@samp{EBZip}
in ASCII string).

@item zip mode (4 bits of the most significant bit side)
This identifies the compression mode.
In EB Library version @value{VERSION}, only 1 (0001 in binary digits)
can be prescribed as this version.

@item compression level (4 bits of the least-significant-bit side)
This identifies the compression level.

@item reserved area (2 bytes)
Reserved but not used.
It is filled with 0x0000.

@item file size (6 bytes)
This contains the size of the original (uncompressed) file.

@item Adler-32 (4 bytes)
This is a checksum value of the uncompressed data computed according
to Adler-32 algorithm described in RFC 1950.

@item mtime (4 bytes)
This gives the most recent modification time of the original file.
This value is the time in seconds since 00:00:00 GMT, Jan. 1, 1970.
@end table

Both @code{zip mode} and @code{compression level} are packed into
the 5th byte in the header.
@code{zip mode} includes a most siginificant bit, and
@code{compression level} includes least-significant-bit.
If @code{zip mode} is 1 and @code{compression level} is 2, then
5th byte of the header is 0x12.

@example
@group
 MSB                         LSB
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 0   0   0   1   0   0   1   0 | = 0x12
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   (zip mode)   | (compression level)
@end group
@end example

All multi-byte numbers in the header are stored with the most
significant byte first.
