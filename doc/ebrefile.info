Introduction
************

   A CD-ROM book usually has some "subbooks".  For example, a certain
CD-ROM book has three subbooks; Japanese dictionary, Japense English
dictinary and English Japanese dictionary.  Each subbook itself is an
independent "book".

                 (CD-ROM book)
     +-----------------------------------+
     |  [English Dicctionary] (subbook)  |
     |  [Japanese Dicctionary](subbook)  |
     |  [Encyclopedia]        (subbook)  |
     +-----------------------------------+

   A CD-ROM book of EB/EBG/EBXA/EBXA-C/S-EBXA format has the file
`CATALOG', and a CD-ROM book of EPWING format has the file `CATALOGS'.
The files define what subbooks the CD-ROM book has.  They are resides
at the top directory of the CD-ROM book.

   `ebrefile' reads an original catalog file and builds a new catalog
file which defines the subbooks only specified by an user.  In other
words, `ebrefile' can deletes particular subbook definitions from a
catalog file.  If a CD-ROM book has three subbooks, `ebrefile' can
imports any one or two subbooks to the new catalog file.  The
`ebrefile' command is useful when you want to copy only a part of a
CD-ROM book to a hard disk.  `ebrefile' is a part of EB Library
distribution.

`ebrefile' modifies contents of a certain file in a CD-ROM book.

Invoking `ebrefile'
*******************

   Its usual way to invoke `ebrefile' is as follows:

     % ebrefile BOOK-PATH

BOOK-PATH points to the top directory of a CD-ROM book where the file
`CATALOG' or `CATALOGS' resides.  Though you cannot specify two or more
book-paths, you can omit book-path like as follows:

     % ebrefile

In this case, `ebrefile' assumes that the current working directory
(`.') is specified.

Select Subbooks
===============

   By default, `ebrefile' imports all subbook definitions in an original
catalog file to a new catalog file.  In short, the new catalog file is
simply copied from an original.  The default behavoir is useless.
`ebrefile' is usually invoked with `--subbook' (`-S') option.

   The `--subbook' option takes an argument which is a list of
directory names of subbooks to be imported, separeted by a comma (`,').
The `ebinfo' command tells you what subbooks your book contains and
what their directory names are.  Suppose that the current working
directory is a top directory of a CD-ROM book.

     % ebinfo
     disc type: EB/EBG/EBXA/EBXA-C/S-EBXA
     character code: JIS X 0208
     the number of subbooks: 3
     subbook 1:
       title: New English Japanese Dictionary (4th edition)
       directory: english
       search methods: word endword keyword menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters: 0xa121 -- 0xa24e
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
     subbook 2:
       title: CD-ROM French Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
       directory: french
       search methods: word endword keyword menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters:
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
     subbook 3:
       title: Pocket German Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
       directory: german
       search methods: menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters:
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

(*Note Invoking `ebinfo': (ebinfo)Invoking ebinfo, for more details
about the `ebinfo' command).
In this example, there are three subbooks in the book, and their
directory names are `english', `french' and `german'.

   Invoking the following command, `ebrefile' build a new catalog file
which has definitions of `english' and `french' only.

     % ebrefile --subbook english,french

Case of the directory names are not sensitve.  An argument to
`--subbook' can be splitted like as follows:

     % ebrefile --subbook english --subbook french

Since `ebrefile' cannot change an order of subbook definitions, the
order of arguments to `--subbook' is not matter.

   `ebrefile' generates new catalog file as `CATALOGS(S).new'.  To
replace original catalog file by new one, type the following commands:

     % mv catalogs catalogs.bak
     % mv catalogs.new catalogs

If you don't have to backup the original file, only the second command
is needed.

   Now, refiling has been completed.  Invoke `ebinfo' again.  The
subbook `germgan' is diappeared.

     % ebinfo
     disc type: EB/EBG/EBXA/EBXA-C/S-EBXA
     character code: JIS X 0208
     the number of subbooks: 2
     
     subbook 1:
       title: New English Japanese Dictionary (4th edition)
       directory: english
       search methods: word endword keyword menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters: 0xa121 -- 0xa24e
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
     subbook 2:
       title: CD-ROM French Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
       directory: french
       search methods: word endword keyword menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters:
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

   If you have already copied whole the CD-ROM book onto a hard disk,
you may remove files of the subbook `german'.  When the directory name
consists of lower case letters, type:

     % rm -r german

Combination with `ebzip'
========================

   `ebrefile' can be used together with the `ebzip' command, which
compresses files in a CD-ROM book (*Note Introduction:
(ebzip)Introduction, for more details about the `ebzip' command).
Usually, the same command line arguments are given to `ebzip' and
`ebrefile'.

   Suppose that a CD-ROM book is mounted on `/cdrom', and this book has
three subbooks; `english', `french' and `german'.  By the following
operation, the subbook `english' and `french' are compressed and put
under the current working directory, and the subbook `german' are
deleted from a subbook list.

     % ebzip --subbook english,french /cdrom
     % ebrefile --subbook english,french /cdrom

If you'd like to put the compressed files onto `/dict' instead of the
current working directory, type the following:

     % ebzip --output-directory /dict --subbook english,french /cdrom
     % ebrefile --output-directory /dict --subbook english,french /cdrom
