Introduction
************

   The `ebfont' command reads the bitmap data of the local defined
characters in a CD-ROM book, convert them to specified image formats,
and write them to files.  `ebfont' uses EB Library and it is
distributed with the library.

   `ebfont' is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it

What is Local Character?
************************

   Many CD-ROM books define their local characters.  For example, some
English Japanese dictionaries define pronunciation marks as the local
characters because the character set used in CD-ROM books doesn't have
pronunciation marks.

   CD-ROM books also have bitmap data of the local characters.  The
`ebfont' command reads the bitmap data, convert them to a specified
image formats, and write them to files.  `ebfont' can generates image
files as XBM (X BitMap format), XPM (X PixMap format), GIF (Graphics
Interchange Format) and/or BMP.  By default, XBM format is selected.

   Local characters are classified to two types; "narrow" and "wide".
In narrow type characters, the height of the bitmap data is about half
of its width.  In wide type characters, the width and height of the
bitmap data are almost same.  A CD-ROM book can defines local
characters of both types.

   The internal fomrat specification of CD-ROM book defines four heights
for local characters, for both narrow and wide types.  Their witdths,
heights and sizes are follows:

height                   narrow                   wide
16                       8x16                     16x16
24                       16x24                    24x24
30                       16x30                    32x30
48                       24x48                    48x48

By deafult, `ebfont' generates image files for fonts with the height of
16 pixels.

Invoking `ebfont'
*****************

   Its usual way to invoke `ebfont' is as follows:

     % ebfont BOOK-PATH

BOOK-PATH points to the top directory of a CD-ROM book where the file
`CATALOG' or `CATALOGS' resides.  Though you cannot specify two or more
book-paths, you can omit book-path like as follows:

     % ebfont

In this case, it is assumed that the current working directory (`.') is
specified.

   `ebfont' generates image files under the current directory.  The
generic forms of their filenames are:

     SUBBOOK/HEIGHT/narrow/CHARACTER-NUMBER.SUFFIX
     SUBBOOK/HEIGHT/wide/CHARACTER-NUMBER.SUFFIX

The SUFFIX is `xbm', `xpm', `gif' or `bmp'.  The CHARACTER-NUMBER is a
hexadecimal number with 4 digits (`0' to `9', and `a' to `f'), like
this:

     ejdict/16/narrow/a121.xbm
     ejdict/16/wide/a321.xbm

The intermediate directories such as `ejdict/16/xbm/narrow' are created
by `ebfont' if missing.

   `ebfont' can outputs image files not only under the current
directory but also any directory by the `--output-directory' option.
The top directory must have been created before invoking `ebfont'.

     % ebfont --output-directory DIRECTORY BOOK-PATH

* Menu:

* Image Formats::               Image Formats.
* Heights::                     Heights.
* Subbooks::                    Subbooks.

Image Formats
=============

   `ebfont' can generates image files of XBM, XPM, GIF89a and BMP
formats.  These image formats are specified at the `--image-format'
(`-i') option.  The `--image-format' option takes an argument which is
a list of image format mames separeted by a comma (`,').  For example,
`ebfont' generates image files of XPM and GIF formats by the following
command:

     % ebfont --image-format xpm,gif BOOK-PATH

An argument to `--image-format' can be splitted like as follows:

     % ebfont --image-format xpm --image-format gif BOOK-PATH

In the XPM and GIF formats, the foreground and background colors of
images are black (`#000000' in RGB) and transparency.  In the BMP
format, foreground and background colors are black and white (`#ffffff'
in RGB).

   `ebzip' generates GIF images without LZW compression algolythm, so
that the their sizes are too fat.

Heights
=======

   By deafult, `ebfont' generates image files for narrow and wide fonts
with the height of 16 pixels.  The `--font-height' (`-f') option allows
you to generate image files of fonts with other heights.  The
`--font-height' option takes an argument which is a list of font
heights separeted by a comma (`,').  The font height must be `16',
`24', `30' and `48'.  For example, `ebfont' generates image files of
fonts with the heights of 16 and 24 pixels by the following command:

     % ebfont --font-height 16,24 BOOK-PATH

An argument to `--font-height' can be splitted like as follows:

     % ebfont --font-height 16 --font-height 24 BOOK-PATH


File: ebfont.info,  Node: Subbooks,  Prev: Heights,  Up: Invoking ebfont

Subbooks
========

   `ebfont' generates image files for all subbooks by default, but the
`--subbook' (`-S') option allows you to generates image files for
specified subbooks only.

   The `--subbook' option takes an argument which is a list of
directory names of subbooks to be compressed, separeted by a comma
(`,').  The `ebinfo' command tells you what subbooks your book contains
and what their directory names are.

     % ebinfo /mnt/cdrom
     disc type: EB/EBG/EBXA/EXBA-C/S-EBXA
     character code: JIS X 0208
     the number of subbooks: 3
     subbook 1:
       title: New English Japanese Dictionary (4th edition)
       directory: english
       search methods: word endword keyword menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters: 0xa121 -- 0xa24e
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
     subbook 2:
       title: CD-ROM French Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
       directory: french
       search methods: word endword keyword menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters:
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
     subbook 3:
       title: Pocket German Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
       directory: german
       search methods: menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters:
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

(*Note Invoking `ebinfo': (ebinfo)Invoking ebinfo, for more details
about the `ebinfo' command).
In this example, there are three subbooks in the book, and their
directory names are `english', `french' and `german'.

   Inkoing the following command, `ebfont' generates image files for
`english' and `french' only.

     % ebfont --subbook english,french /mnt/cdrom

Case of the directory names are not sensitve.  An argument to
`--subbook' can be splitted like as follows:

     % ebfont --subbook english --subbook french /mnt/cdrom
