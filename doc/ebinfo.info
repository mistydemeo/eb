Invoking `ebinfo'
*****************

   Its usual way to invoke `ebinfo' is as follows:

     % ebinfo BOOK-PATH

BOOK-PATH points to the top directory of a CD-ROM book where the file
`CATALOG' or `CATALOGS' resides.  Though you cannot specify two or more
book-paths, you can omit book-path like as follows:

     % ebinfo

In this case, `ebinfo' assumes that the current working directory (`.')
is specified.  `ebinfo' outputs information about the specified book
like as follows:

     % ebinfo /mnt/cdrom
     disc type: EB/EBG/EBXA/EBXA-C/S-EBXA
     character code: JIS X 0208
     the number of subbooks: 2
     subbook 1:
       title: New English Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
       directory: ejdict
       search methods: word endword keyword menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters: 0xa121 -- 0xa24e
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
     subbook 2:
       title: How to use the book
       directory: howto
       search methods: word endword keyword menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters:
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

   If a subbook in the book supports multi-search, `ebinfo' also
outputs detail information about multi-search by specifying the
`--multi-search' (or `-m') option.  The mulit-search information is
like as follows.

       multi search 1:
         label 1: country or region
           with candidates: yes
         label 2: period
           with candidates: no
         label 3: category
           with candidates: yes
         label 4: authority
           with candidates: no
       multi search 2:
         label 1: author
           with candidates: no
         label 2: title
           with candidates: no
         label 3: date
           with candidates: no
         label 4: publisher
           with candidates: no
